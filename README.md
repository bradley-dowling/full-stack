## How to run:
- cd into backend
- install the virtual python environment with `python -m venv env` (NOTE: you may need to install venv as well)
- install flask with `pip install flask`
- install python-dotenv with `pip install python-dotenv`
- cd back into main directory and run `npm install` to install react dependencies
- run `npm start` to start up the front-end
- open a new terminal (in the same directory) and run `npm run start-backend` to start up the back-end
- if the react app doesn't appear, navigate to `localhost:3000`
